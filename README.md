# RustJourney

A collection of Rust code and projects created while learning the language, primarily following [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). This repository documents my journey through Rust's fundamentals, hands-on experiments, and small projects to enhance my understanding and proficiency in Rust.

## About

This repository serves as my learning playground for Rust. Each folder represents a different chapter or concept from the book, with accompanying examples, exercises, and projects.

The main areas covered include:
- Basic Syntax and Concepts
- Ownership and Borrowing
- Error Handling
- Structs and Enums
- Lifetimes
- Traits and Generics
- Concurrency
- Collections and Iterators
- Building and testing Rust projects

## Projects

Here is a list of projects and exercises from the book:

1. **Hello World** - The first Rust program.
2. **Guessing Game** - A simple guessing game from Chapter 2.
3. **Ownership Examples** - Various examples explaining Rust’s ownership system.
4. **Structs & Enums** - Examples to demonstrate the power of structs and enums.
5. **Concurrency** - Simple multi-threading examples and async code.

More projects will be added as I progress through the book.

## Installation

To run any of the Rust code examples, you’ll need to have [Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) on your machine.

Once installed, you can run the examples with the following commands:

```bash
# Navigate to the project folder
cd path/to/project

# Build and run the project
cargo run
