# RustJourney
A collection of Rust code and projects created while learning the language, primarily following [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). This repository documents my journey through Rust's fundamentals, hands-on experiments, and small projects, enhancing my understanding and proficiency in Rust.
